# **Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication (Manim)**

This project provides an animated visualization of fundamental linear algebra concepts: vector addition and scalar multiplication. Developed using the Manim animation engine, this visualization offers an intuitive geometric understanding of these operations.

## **Project Overview**

Understanding vectors and their basic operations is crucial in linear algebra, physics, and computer graphics. This project brings these concepts to life through smooth, high-quality animations, making them easier to grasp than static diagrams.

### **Visualized Concepts:**

1. **Vector Addition**: Demonstrates the "head-to-tail" rule and the parallelogram rule for adding two vectors, showing how the resultant vector is formed.  
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: Illustrates how multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude (length) and potentially its direction (if the scalar is negative).

## **Features**

* **High-Quality Animations**: Utilizes the Manim library for visually appealing and mathematically accurate animations.  
* **Clear Geometric Interpretation**: Focuses on the visual representation of vector operations.  
* **Customizable Vectors & Scalars**: Easily modify the input vectors and scalar range in the script.  
* **Modular Design**: The animation is structured into clear sections for each concept.

## **How to Run**

To run this Manim animation, you'll need Python and the Manim Community Edition library installed.

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.8 or higher  
* Manim Community Edition (manim)  
* A LaTeX distribution (like MiKTeX on Windows, MacTeX on macOS, or TeX Live on Linux) installed and configured in your system's PATH. Manim uses LaTeX to render mathematical text.

### **Installation**

1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):  
   It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.  
   conda create \-n manim\_env python=3.10  
   conda activate manim\_env

2. Install Manim:  
   With your environment activated, install Manim:  
   pip install manim

3. **Install LaTeX Distribution:**  
   * **Windows**: Download and install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). During installation, ensure you select "Install for all users" and confirm it adds itself to your system's PATH. Also, enable "Install missing packages on-the-fly."  
   * **macOS**: Install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).  
   * **Linux**: Install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) (e.g., sudo apt-get install texlive-full on Debian/Ubuntu, though a smaller installation might suffice if Manim only uses basic packages).

**Important**: After installing LaTeX, **close and reopen your terminal/Anaconda Prompt** to ensure the PATH variables are updated. You can verify installation by typing pdflatex \--version or dvisvgm \--version.

### **Execution**

1. Navigate to the project directory:  
   Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and change to the directory where you saved Vector\_Addition\_and\_Scalar\_Multiplication.py:  
   cd "C:\\Users\\hp\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Manim Projects\\Visualize vector addition\\"

2. **Run the Manim script:**  
   manim \-pql Vector\_Addition\_and\_Scalar\_Multiplication.py VectorOperationsVisualization

   * \-p: Plays the video after rendering.  
   * \-q: Specifies the quality. l for low (480p), m for medium (720p), h for high (1080p), k for 4K. \-ql is good for quick previews.  
   * Vector\_Addition\_and\_Scalar\_Multiplication.py: The name of your Python script file.  
   * VectorOperationsVisualization: The name of the class within your script that defines the animation.

The animation video will be saved in a media/videos/\<script\_name\>/\<quality\_folder\>/ subdirectory within your project folder.

## **Project Structure**

* Vector\_Addition\_and\_Scalar\_Multiplication.py: The main Manim script for visualizing vector addition and scalar multiplication.  
* README.md: This file.  
* media/: (Automatically generated by Manim) Contains the rendered video output.

## **Customization**

You can easily modify the following variables at the top of the Vector\_Addition\_and\_Scalar\_Multiplication.py script:

* VECTOR\_A\_NP, VECTOR\_B\_NP: Change these NumPy arrays to define different vectors for addition.  
* VECTOR\_V\_NP: Modify this array to change the vector for scalar multiplication.  
* SCALAR\_MIN, SCALAR\_MAX: Adjust the range of scalar values for the animation.  
* ANIMATION\_DURATION\_SCALAR: Control the speed of the scalar multiplication animation.
